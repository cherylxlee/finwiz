## üîç Retrieval System Under the Hood

The DCF Extract tool utilizes a sophisticated retrieval system to accurately extract financial metrics:

1. **Vector Database**: Uses Pinecone with Cohere embeddings to store chunked 10-K documents
2. **Company-Specific Strategies**: Custom retrieval patterns for each company's unique 10-K formatting
3. **Multi-Query Approach**: Employs multiple specialized queries per financial metric to maximize recall
4. **Content Classification**: Identifies financial tables, income statements, and specific metrics through pattern matching
5. **Specialized Extraction**: Uses targeted approaches for challenging metrics (CapEx, Depreciation)
